# Grocery-Optimization

How do we save money on daily grocery but still have enough nutrition to stay healthy? That question always came to my mind. What to buy? Is this too expensive? This food is expensive but is it worth it?
That's the reason I coded this program to minimize your spending but you still have enough nutrition for each day. The result is the amound of food you should eat 1 day with the cheapest price. This is the "optimal" meal, so there's only one solution.

Input: dataset of food including these attributes: name, price/serving, serving size, kcal, protein, fat, carb, fat, suger, calcium, vitamin A, vitamin C, iron.
Output: 1 lowest price food intake but satisfies all nutrition requirements

Method: Linear Programming

Libraries used: pandas, pulp

P/S: after this program, I realize that cheap food but high in nutrition include: oat, chia seed, eggs, milk. 

Have a healthy lifestyle!
